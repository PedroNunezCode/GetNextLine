# GetNextLine
Get next line is a simple function that will allow to read a line ending with a newline character from a file descriptor.
I was able to gain a deeper understanding of allocations, whether they happen on the
stack memory or in the heap memory, the manipulation and the life cycle of a buffer, the
unexpected complexity implied in the use of one or many static variables.
